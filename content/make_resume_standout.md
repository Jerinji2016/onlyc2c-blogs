*Even If You're Getting Ignored Right Now*  

> *“Am I invisible or just really good at hiding on job boards?”*  
If you’ve ever shouted this into the void of LinkedIn after sending out 47 applications with zero callbacks, this one’s for you.

C2C resumes follow a slightly different playbook—and yes, **you need to flex like a business**, not just a job seeker. Let’s turn your resume into a recruiter magnet. 🧲

## 📃 W2 Resume vs. C2C Resume: What's the Difference?

| Feature               | W2 Resume                     | C2C Resume                        |
|-----------------------|-------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| Job Duration          | Longer-term roles             | Project-based, short-term gigs    |
| Employer Mention      | Focus on the company          | Focus on **your business name**   |
| Deliverables Highlight| Optional                      | **Critical**                      |

> ✅ Pro Tip: Use “*Your LLC Name* (Contracted with Client XYZ)” for each role.

## ✨ How to Highlight Contracting Experience

Instead of saying:

> *“Worked on backend services for fintech app.”*

Say:

> *“Delivered scalable backend microservices for [Client Name] under a 6-month contract via [Your LLC]. Reduced API response time by 45%.”*

👏 Specific. Quantifiable. C2C gold.

## 🔍 Keywords Recruiters Look For

If your resume doesn’t mention **“contract,” “consulting,” “delivered,” “1099,” “Corp to Corp,”** or **“project-based,”** it’s time for a refresh.

> ✅ Sprinkle in relevant tools, tech, AND contract-related terms.

Also: Mention clients or industries you’ve worked with (finance, healthcare, SaaS)—that helps match niche gigs.

> The next time a recruiter reads your resume, they should think:
