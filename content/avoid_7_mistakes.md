> _"Hiring C2C consultants is easy..."_
Said no recruiter ever (at least not after their first compliance audit).

If you’ve ever tried to onboard a Corp to Corp (C2C) consultant and felt like you were signing a peace treaty rather than a contract, this post is for you.

Whether you're new to C2C or just want to avoid a tax-season facepalm, here are **7 common mistakes to dodge**—with tip #5 being one that could hit your budget _hard_.

---

## Mistake 1: 📄 Misclassifying the Consultant

**Oops! You thought C2C = Independent Contractor = No Worries?**
Wrong. If the consultant is operating under a business entity, great! If not, you might be on shaky legal ground.

> ✅ Tip: Always ensure they’re incorporated (LLC, S-Corp, etc.) and not just _claiming_ to be C2C.

## Mistake 2: 🧾 Skipping the Business Legitimacy Check

Would you hire someone who says they’re a "CEO" but their company has no website, no EIN, and their business address is a Taco Bell?
Didn’t think so.

> ✅ Ask for their **EIN**, **business license**, and verify their entity via [state databases](https://www.sba.gov).

---

## Mistake 3: 🚫 No Written Agreement

Verbal agreements are cool—for pizza orders. Not so much for C2C contracts.

> ✅ Always get a proper **MSA (Master Service Agreement)** and **SOW (Statement of Work)** in place. Spell out payment terms, scope, and end date clearly.

## Mistake 4: 🕵️‍♂️ Skimping on Background Checks

Just because they’re not your employee doesn’t mean you skip background verification. Some clients (especially in finance or healthcare) _require_ it.

> ✅ Background check, drug test (if required), and reference calls still matter—yes, even for C2C.

---

## Mistake 5: 💸 Ignoring Tax Implications

**THIS ONE HURTS.**
If you misclassify or work with someone without verifying their business status, you might be on the hook for employment taxes and penalties.

> ✅ Keep records of **certificates of incorporation**, **insurance**, and **all contracts** for at least 3–7 years.

## Mistake 6: 🛑 Failing to Define Project Boundaries

C2C consultants are not full-time employees. You can’t expect them to be in daily standups, company Slack channels, or joining holiday parties. (Unless there’s cake.)

> ✅ Respect the **B2B nature** of the relationship. Set deliverables, not clock-in times.

---

## Mistake 7: ✅ No Internal C2C Hiring Process

Winging it every time? That’s risky.
Having no standard process = inconsistent vetting = legal nightmares.

> ✅ Create a **C2C checklist** for your team:

- Verify company details
- Collect documentation
- Align on deliverables
- Confirm insurance, NDAs, etc.

## Final Thoughts: Hire Smart, Not Sorry

C2C hiring doesn’t have to be scary—or expensive. With a few checks and clear boundaries, you can find awesome talent without the HR horror stories.

> Don’t just protect your company—protect your **peace of mind.**
