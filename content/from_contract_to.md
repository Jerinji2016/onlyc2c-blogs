*A Guide for Both Recruiters and Candidates Who Want to Stop Ghosting Each Other*  

> *“It’s not just a transaction—it’s a relationship (with contracts).”*

In the world of Corp to Corp (C2C), trust isn’t a *nice to have*—it’s everything. One misstep and boom, you’re blocked faster than a recruiter sending a “Hi 👋” at 11 PM on LinkedIn.

Whether you're a recruiter building your dream talent bench or a candidate looking for gigs that don’t feel sketchy, here’s how to build real trust—C2C style.

## 🏗️ For Recruiters: Build a Long-Term C2C Pipeline

Hiring C2C isn’t just about filling today’s req. Think *relationship management*, not *talent vending machine*.

> ✅ Keep a vetted list of solid consultants  
> ✅ Track what tech they specialize in  
> ✅ Re-engage them regularly (even when you don’t have a role)

💬 A “Hey, saw a new React version drop—thought of you” goes a long way.

## 🤔 What C2C Candidates *Actually* Want

Spoiler: It’s not just a paycheck.

- Transparent rate breakdowns (no funny business)  
- Real client names (not “top-tier Fortune 500 in stealth mode”)  
- Respect for their time (skip the 4-round interviews for a 3-month contract)

> ✅ Set expectations early. "It’s a 6-month remote contract with XYZ, $75/hr C2C, 2 rounds of interviews" = 🔥

## 🗣️ Communication Tips (For Both Sides)

Recruiters:

- Don’t ghost. Even “no update yet” is better than silence.  
- Share feedback if things don’t move forward.

Candidates:

- Respond professionally—even if you’re not interested.  
- Keep your LLC paperwork, resume, and availability updated.

> 💡 Bonus: Use tools like Calendly, email templates, and Slack channels to stay streamlined.

## 🛡️ Be Transparent, Stay Compliant

A trusted relationship is built on **clarity + compliance**:

- Verify the candidate's **business entity**  
- Share clear **MSAs/SOWs**  
- Confirm **insurance**, **background check needs**, and **start dates** up front

No hidden clauses. No awkward surprises. Just two businesses working together like pros.

## Final Word: Trust Is the Real ROI

When recruiters show up with transparency and professionalism, and candidates respond with clarity and consistency, magic happens:  
✅ Faster onboarding  
✅ Better contracts  
✅ Long-term relationships that actually *work*

> In C2C, you’re not just building contracts—you’re building a reputation.
