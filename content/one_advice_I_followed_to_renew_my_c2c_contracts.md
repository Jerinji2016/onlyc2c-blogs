> _"Success at work doesn't always come from coding harder..."_  
Sometimes, it's about being the kind of person others want to keep around.

Here are **3 underrated soft skills** that can make or break your contract renewal — especially if you're in a C2C or contract role.

## 1. 🍩 Keep Your Supervisor Happy (like a donut!)

I got this advice during a casual dinner.

> "Always make sure your immediate supervisor is happy as a donut."

And it stuck with me.

Yes! Always be nice and deliver the tasks your immediate supervisor asks you to do. Because at the end of the day, top-level management — listen to me — always asks them if they want to keep you on the team or not.

And the guy who gave me this advice? He's still on the same contract... **for ages**!

## 2. 🤝 Be Nice to Everyone

You might not be the most technical person. You might not be the best programmer. But guess what?

> Knowledge alone is not the only key to a successful team.

Always be empathetic and kind toward your teammates. Never insult or show even the slightest sense of superiority when someone makes a mistake.

Just be nice:

- Share your ideas  
- Ask for opinions  
- Work as a team  

This mindset always helps in the long run!

## 3. ⏰ Get to Meetings 3–5 Minutes Early

Make a habit of joining meetings a few minutes early. That’s when **real bonding** happens. Talk about:

- The weather  
- Weekend plans  

Keep it light — not too personal.

> Genuine small talk builds trust and a relaxed environment — and relaxed teams tend to be more productive.

## Final Thoughts: People Skills Matter

Hard skills get you hired.  
Soft skills get you **re-hired**.

If you're working contract, remember:  
It's not always about code. It's about **connection**.
