<h1> The Ultimate Guide to Corp to Corp: What Every Tech Consultant & Recruiter Should Know </h1>

_“Wait… am I a company now?”_  
That was my exact thought when I first heard about Corp to Corp (C2C). As a software developer who just wanted to code and collect paychecks, suddenly being asked for my “EIN” and to “incorporate” made me question if I’d accidentally started an empire.

So if you're like I was—either a tech consultant being offered a C2C role, or a recruiter trying to understand what the heck C2C really means—let me save you some Googling, head-scratching, and LinkedIn DMs.

*** 

## What is Corp to Corp (C2C), Really?

Corp to Corp is a business-to-business contract. You (the consultant) form a legal business entity—usually an LLC or S-Corp—and provide your services through that business to a client or staffing agency. So technically, it’s not “you” who’s being hired. It’s your business. You're basically Beyoncé and the CEO of Beyoncé, Inc.

This setup is different from:

- W2 Employment: You're a direct employee. Taxes are withheld, benefits are offered, and HR sends you birthday emails.
- 1099 (Independent Contractor): You're self-employed, but not necessarily under a formal business structure. Taxes? That’s all on you. Good luck during tax season.

## C2C vs W2 vs 1099: The Tinder Bio Version

| Mode | Relationship Type | Taxes | Benefits | Ideal For |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| W2 | "In a committed relationship" | Employer handles it | Yes | Long-term employees |
| 1099 | "It’s complicated" | You're on your own | Nope | Short gigs, side hustles |
| C2C | "It’s business, not personal" | Through your biz | Not usually | Independent consultants, tech contractors |

## Benefits of C2C: Why People Love It

### For Consultants

- __More money (usually):__ Since the client isn't paying for your benefits, they often pay a higher hourly rate.
- __Tax write-offs:__ Business expenses like laptops, internet, or even a portion of your home office can be deducted.
- __Be your own __boss: Set your own terms. No weird team-building Zoom calls unless you schedule them.

### For Recruiters/Clients

- __No tax obligations:__ You're not an employer—you're just hiring a business.

- __Less risk:__ No employee misclassification worries if it’s done right.

- __Access to niche talent:__ Many senior consultants prefer C2C for flexibility.

## Legal & Tax Stuff: But Make It Simple

Yes, you’ll need to:

- Register an LLC or S-Corp
- Get an EIN (Employer Identification Number)
- File taxes as a business, which often means quarterly payments

Don’t worry—this sounds scary, but thousands of us have done it without turning into accountants. Find a good CPA, ideally one who knows tech consulting. They’re worth every penny and possibly your sanity.

## When Should You Go C2C?

### C2C might be your jam if

- You like contract roles and freelance freedom
- You’re working with agencies that require it
- You’re earning enough to justify the extra setup

### Stick with W2 or 1099 if

- You want health benefits and stability
- You’re just testing the waters with freelancing
- You hate paperwork more than you love tax deductions

## Final Thoughts: You're Not Alone

Going C2C can feel like a leap—from employee to entrepreneur. But it’s a path many consultants walk, and once you figure out the setup, you might never want to go back. Just remember: it's business, but that doesn't mean it can't be personal too—especially when that tax refund hits.

So whether you're a consultant building your empire or a recruiter trying to navigate C2C hires, now you know the ropes. Go forth, file those EINs, and may your contracts always be clear.
