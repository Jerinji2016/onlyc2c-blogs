*For Tech Consultants & Recruiters Who Just Want Straight Answers*  

> *“Am I... a business now?”*  
That’s the usual reaction when someone first hears “Corp to Corp.” Don’t worry—you’re not accidentally starting Amazon. You’re just stepping into a more *grown-up* way to freelance. Let’s break it down.

## 💼 What is Corp to Corp?

C2C means **you work through your own company**—usually an LLC or S-Corp—and contract with clients as a **business**, not as an individual.

So instead of hiring *you*, the client hires **“You, Inc.”**

## ⚖️ C2C vs W2 vs 1099

Here’s the “I-don’t-have-time-for-this” version:

| Type     | Taxes             | Benefits | Vibe                |
|----------|-------------------|----------|---------------------|
| **W2**   | Employer handles it | Yes      | 9-to-5 energy       |
| **1099** | You handle it       | Nope     | Wild west freelancer|
| **C2C**  | Through your biz    | Rarely   | Consultant CEO      |

## 🧾 But What About Legal & Taxes?

To go C2C, you’ll need:  
✅ An LLC (or S-Corp)  
✅ An EIN (basically your biz’s SSN)  
✅ A good CPA (aka your financial Gandalf)  

It *sounds* complex, but once you’re set up, it runs smoothly. Think of it like a one-time boss battle.

## 🤔 Should You Go C2C?

**C2C is great if:**

✔️ You love contracting/freelancing  
✔️ You’re earning enough to justify it  
✔️ You want flexibility + tax perks  

**Stick to W2 or 1099 if:**  

❌ You want benefits + less admin  
❌ You’re just testing the waters  
❌ You’d rather never talk to the IRS

### TL;DR: C2C = You’re the Business

Yes, C2C sounds fancy. But really, it’s just a smart way to work on your own terms. You’ll need to do a bit of setup, but the rewards? Freedom, money, and bragging rights at networking events.
